Ryan,

By now, you are probably feeling left out. I saved you for last =97 not bec=
ause you are most important, but because you were the most blatantly obviou=
s.

Kati orchestrated it. You executed it without question.
Logan enabled it through betrayal. You threatened police intervention.
Allison formalized it. You delivered the dismissal by phone.
Lisa shielded it. You showed up at my RV an hour later to collect keys.

Everyone else operated with institutional calculation. You operated with vo=
latility barely contained.

I'm forwarding you an email I sent on February 12, 2025 =97 four days after=
 you confronted me without my supervisor present and cataloged my first-wee=
k mistakes.

Proof I was trying to de-escalate while you were already escalating. Proof =
I remained reasonable while enduring your abusive behavior. Proof you were =
the volatile one from the start.

I was never confused about you. I saw what you were doing from the very beg=
inning.

"A park manager showed up at the start of his shift, without his direct sup=
ervisor for support, and this created a whole new situation."

That was you. February 9. Managerial intimidation. I documented it in real-=
time while trying to de-escalate.

I tried to make this work. I offered to conform. I asked you to get to know=
 me. I wrote in third person to soften what you were already doing to me.

What happened next:

Six more weeks of systematic abuse.

MARCH 5: You summon me to public picnic table for over an hour. Tell me to =
"chew glass and swallow it." Admit I was never given benefit of the doubt. =
Repeatedly suggest I leave. Entire meeting recorded.

MARCH 18: Unidentified man approaches me while I'm cleaning yurts alone. In=
terrogates me about my treatment by leadership. I document immediately. Kat=
i Baker explains it as "IT photo documentation." No photos ever produced.

MARCH 24: You dismiss me by phone over a homeless man's lost journal. I tel=
l you you're a bully. I say: if you escalate, I will escalate. You ask if y=
ou should call the cops. One hour later: you show up at my RV to collect ke=
ys, admit on camera no formal documentation exists.

From February 9 to March 24. Every step documented. Every escalation record=
ed.

I saw it from the beginning. I named it in that February 12 email. I offere=
d a path forward.

You escalated anyway. All the way to threatening police intervention agains=
t a volunteer who called you a bully.

You weren't the architect. That was Kati. But you were the perfect instrume=
nt =97 volatile enough to deliver "chew glass and swallow it," insecure eno=
ugh to threaten cops when held accountable, compliant enough to execute wit=
hout questioning the pattern.

The email proves I tried. The timeline proves you escalated. The recordings=
 prove your volatility. The archive makes it permanent.

You thought you were managing a problem volunteer. You were actually creati=
ng comprehensive documentation of institutional abuse with yourself at the =
center of execution.

That's why you're last. Not because you matter most. Because you were the m=
ost blatantly obvious from day one.

And I saw you.

Subject: Re: Jessie M. Honeyman State Park Hosting for March 2025

Dear Ryan, Kati, and Logan:

I would like to start by saying what an honor it has been to be at Honeyman=
 and to experience this place firsthand, and I deeply respect the energy an=
d commitment it takes to manage a place like this.

I have had a few days to think about what happened. I would like to offer m=
y perspective for your consideration and a possible path forward, if you'll=
 do me the honor of considering it.

First, there was an unfortunate confluence of events. A water outage, an an=
gry guest, a power outage, an angry guest, a new volunteer, the early morni=
ng hour, a hesitant text for clarification, and a reply that didn't quite m=
ake the volunteer feel he had his bearings here.

Next, the volunteer asserted a boundary as softly as he could and he felt i=
t was respected and was already moving on, but the system saw it differentl=
y, and a park manager showed up at the start of his shift, without his dire=
ct supervisor for support, and this created a whole new situation.

This volunteer is new to this life, to volunteering at the state parks, and=
 just trying to navigate it with as much care as he can possibly muster. He=
's not here trying to stand out or create waves of any kind. He just wants =
to be supported as he learns to integrate into this rhythm.

I have been worried all week. I have not seen Logan, and that feels purpose=
ful. Because he could have put my mind at ease instantly. I would like to a=
sk we reset. Please take the time to get to know me. I sincerely believe I =
can be a valuable resource to you. And I want that so much.

And my time here is so limited. If you don't want me back here next year, I=
 will understand this. I will regret it, because I care about this place an=
d I really thought I was building something meaningful here. But I will und=
erstand.

I have volunteer assignments lined up all year as I explore this wonderful =
coast. I don't want to jeopardize that. I will conform. I will recalibrate.=
 I will be a model volunteer. I hope that you will give me that opportunity=
.

Sam

I would like to start by saying what an honor it has been to be at Honeyman=

First, there was an unfortunate confluence of events. A water outage, an an=
gry guest, a power outage, an angry guest, a new volunteer, the early morni=
ng hour, a hesitant text for clarification, and a reply that didn't quite m=

 bearings here.</div>

Next, the volunteer asserted a boundary as softly as he could and he felt i=
t was respected and was already moving on, but the system saw it differentl=
y, and a park manager showed up at the start of his shift, without his dire=

 created a whole new situation.</div>
