            <div className="mt-4">
                During my March 25 call with OPRD Volunteer Coordinator Allison Watson, she asked me
                about my views on "the end of the world" using the same tone Ryan did at the day use
                area meeting.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                I recognized instantly where that came from and what its purpose was, and I knew from
                that moment onward that Allison was not actually listening to me, she was documenting
                my expulsion. I told her that what I observe is instability in our systems, and nothing
                more, because it was deeply inappropriate of her to be asking me such a question.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                This question was inappropriate professional conduct and represented a weaponization of
                personal information I had shared in confidence with my direct supervisor Logan during
                a vulnerable moment.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Original Context</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Logan and I took a walk during my time at Honeyman. He had just spent 90 minutes in the
                Welcome Center talking about himself—his background, his concerns, his perspectives. The
                following day, I reciprocated by sharing why I had moved into an RV and relocated to the
                coast, and what I had sacrificed to make that transition.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                This was not conspiracy theorizing. It was pattern recognition based on observable
                systemic instabilities—economic volatility, climate change impacts, social fragmentation,
                and institutional breakdown. These are documented realities, not fringe beliefs.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Distortion</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                What I shared as reasoned analysis of systemic risk was later reframed by Allison Watson
                as apocalyptic thinking, used to pathologize my character and justify institutional
                dismissal.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Sexual Targeting Claim</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Allison also claimed I told Logan "I was worried he would kill me." This is a significant
                distortion of what I actually said.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                What I shared was my concern that in an authoritarian phase—a documented historical
                pattern—my sexuality would be weaponized against me, and that people like him
                (institutional actors, authority figures) would be the mechanism through which such
                targeting would occur.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Logan visibly recoiled when I said this. At the time, I interpreted his reaction as
                discomfort with the subject matter. Later, I understood: he was actively doing exactly
                what I had described—using institutional position to target my identity.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Betrayal</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                This walk represents the moment Logan betrayed my trust. It was the only time during my
                service that I opened up to him personally, sharing both my strategic thinking and my
                vulnerabilities as a queer person navigating institutional spaces.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                He took that vulnerability and weaponized it—first in internal communications, then in
                the dismissal process where personal confidences became "behavioral concerns."
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Pattern</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">This represents a classic institutional tactic:</div>

            <ol className="list-decimal list-outside ml-8 mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Elicit vulnerability through false intimacy and reciprocal sharing</li>
                <li>Document private thoughts as professional concerns</li>
                <li>Pathologize reasonable analysis as extremist thinking</li>
                <li>Weaponize identity-based fears as evidence of instability</li>
                <li>Use personal confidences to justify institutional retaliation</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">Professional Misconduct</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Allison Watson's use of this information violated basic professional boundaries:
            </div>

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8 mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>Inappropriate inquiry:</strong> Asking about personal beliefs unrelated to
                    volunteer service
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Confidentiality breach:</strong> Using information shared privately with
                    direct supervisor
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pathologizing:</strong> Framing systemic analysis as mental health concerns
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identity targeting:</strong> Using sexuality-based fears to justify dismissal
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Strategic Purpose</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">This line of questioning served to:</div>

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8 mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Distract from documented management misconduct</li>
                <li>Reframe institutional accountability as personal instability</li>
                <li>Create psychological profile justifying permanent dismissal</li>
                <li>Weaponize vulnerability shared in confidence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">Why This Matters</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                When volunteers share personal context with supervisors, that information should remain
                confidential unless it directly impacts service safety. Using personal beliefs and
                identity-based concerns to justify retaliation creates a chilling effect that discourages
                authentic relationships and honest communication.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                The fact that my analysis of systemic instability—made in early 2025—has proven
                increasingly accurate does not retroactively justify its weaponization against me.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">Current Reality</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                The "end of the world" thinking they pathologized looks increasingly like competent risk
                assessment. Institutional breakdown, climate disruption, social fragmentation, and
                authoritarian targeting of marginalized groups are not conspiracy theories—they are
                observable realities requiring adaptive responses.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Living in an RV, maintaining mobility, developing resilience skills, and building
                community connections outside traditional institutional frameworks represents practical
                preparation, not apocalyptic thinking.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The Deeper Violation</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Beyond professional misconduct, this represents a fundamental betrayal of human trust.
                I shared my deepest concerns about institutional targeting of queer people with someone
                who was, in that moment, engaged in institutional targeting of me as a queer person.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                The irony is brutal: I warned Logan about exactly what he was doing to me.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-8 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-emerald-600 italic text-sm">
                <strong>Documentation Note:</strong> This record exists to prevent further weaponization
                of personal information shared in confidence. The original context was vulnerability and
                trust-building. The institutional use was retaliation and pathologization. The difference
                matters.
            </div>
