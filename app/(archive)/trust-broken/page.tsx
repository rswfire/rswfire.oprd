<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Logan,

I don’t trust you, and that’s because your actions have given me no reason to.

When I confided in you about the situation with Kati, you escalated it instead of protecting me. Then you disappeared.

When I applied for a job here, you distanced yourself again. The moment I withdrew my application, you reappeared—spending ninety minutes talking about yourself.

When I finally opened up to you about why I’m here, what I sacrificed to be here, and why this matters to me, you responded by trying to manage my perception instead of actually listening.

And then? You distanced yourself again.

When I warned you—privately—to prevent a repeat of the Kati situation, you assured me Leaf would train me. That didn’t happen.

At every critical moment, you have failed to act with integrity.
At every opportunity to lead, you have instead chosen avoidance.

I will continue to do my job professionally for the next month.
You will ensure that my contributions are recognized appropriately in your system.

I will not allow the dysfunction here to interfere with my larger trajectory.
If there is any pushback on this, understand that I am fully prepared for it.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">DECEMBER 10, 2025 &mdash; NAMING THE HARM</h2>

            <Email
                from="Robert Samuel White"
                to="Logan Bliss, Volunteer Services Lead"
                cc="Kati Baker, Ryan Warren, Allison Watson, Lisa Sumption"
                date="December 10, 2025"
                subject="Naming the Harm"
            >
<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Logan,

This letter names the harm you caused through betrayal of supervisory trust and weaponization of vulnerability I shared with you in confidence.

You held authority over me as Volunteer Services Lead. That role requires integrity, discretion, and the protection of those under your supervision. You failed at every level.

THE DISCLOSURES

During our walk at Honeyman, I shared why I had moved into an RV and relocated to the coast—my analysis of systemic instability, my strategic thinking about resilience, and my concerns as a queer person about authoritarian targeting through institutional actors.

Before that conversation, I set a clear boundary: I told you explicitly this was not romantic for me.

You took what I shared in confidence and disclosed it to management. That information was then weaponized by Allison Watson to pathologize my character during dismissal proceedings—reframing reasoned analysis as "apocalyptic thinking" and using my fears about identity-based targeting as evidence of instability.

By now you have seen the videos. You know how they used what I told you. You know the harm that followed.

THE DISTORTION

Allison Watson claimed I told you "I was worried you would kill me." That is a deliberate distortion.

What I actually said was that in authoritarian contexts, people like you—institutional actors with authority—would be the mechanism through which targeting of queer people would occur.

You visibly recoiled when I said this.

At the time, I interpreted your reaction as discomfort with the subject matter. Later, I understood: you were already doing exactly what I had described—using your institutional position to target my identity.

And you did this after I explicitly told you the conversation was not romantic. You weaponized a boundary I set with you in good faith.

THE PATTERN

You elicited trust through reciprocal vulnerability. You spent 90 minutes talking about yourself—your background, your concerns, your perspectives. The following day, I reciprocated. That is how trust-building works.

But after I opened up, you distanced yourself. Then you disclosed what I shared to people who were already working to remove me.

That is not supervision. That is betrayal.

THE ENABLING

Your disclosures gave Ryan Warren, Kati Baker, and Allison Watson the ammunition they needed to justify what they had already decided to do.

Ryan used it to mock me at the day-use meeting—suggesting I "thought I had a future with you"—weaponizing my sexuality and distorting ordinary human connection into something inappropriate.

I am certain that insinuation entered the narrative with your consent.

Kati and Allison used your disclosures to construct a psychological profile justifying my permanent dismissal—reframing vulnerability as instability, analysis as extremism, and identity-based fears as concerning behavior.

You enabled that. Actively. With full knowledge of what they were doing.

WHAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND

I treated you with integrity you never had.

Despite your pattern of intimacy followed by distance, I continued to see the best in you. I made space for the tension between your depth and the institution you serve. I chose to believe you were capable of better.

I was wrong.

You had every opportunity to protect what I shared with you. Instead, you delivered it to people who used it to harm me.

That choice—to betray supervisory trust and weaponize queer vulnerability after I explicitly set a boundary with you—is now part of the permanent record.

THE RECORD

You are documented by full name in a public archive:

https://oprdvolunteerabuse.org/trust-broken
https://oprdvolunteerabuse.org/trust-broken/supplemental

This archive details:

  * Your disclosure of confidential personal information
  * Your participation in identity-based targeting
  * Your weaponization of a boundary I set with you
  * Your role in enabling institutional abuse

This is not a request for response.

This is a statement of record.

Your choices as Volunteer Services Lead are now permanently attached to your name.
