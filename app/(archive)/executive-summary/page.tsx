            <div className="mt-4">
                In early 2025, I served as an unpaid volunteer at Honeyman State Park in Oregon. What
                began as a routine volunteer assignment became two months of systematic psychological
                harassment, coercive tactics, and institutional retaliation — all documented with audio
                and video evidence.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">HOW IT STARTED</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                My second week there, I sent a respectful text to Park Supervisor Kati Baker about a
                power outage, noting that guests would perceive me as responsible for resolving it. Her
                dismissive response led me to share that her tone made me feel small. This single exchange
                became the pretext for everything that followed.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE ESCALATION</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                What should have been a minor communication issue became a sustained campaign of
                psychological pressure:
            </div>

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Same Day</strong>: Park Manager Ryan Warren confronted me alone, cataloguing
                    every minor mistake from my first week as a new volunteer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>February</strong>: Systematic undermining of my supervisor relationships and
                    isolation from normal support systems, requiring me to document it with the "Trust" email.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>March 5</strong>: Orchestrated meeting where I was told to "chew glass and
                    swallow it" and that I would never be given the benefit of the doubt. I recorded the
                    entire meeting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>March 10</strong>: Engagement Programs Manager Allison Watson called about my
                    March 5 recording, informing me I was "acting as an agent of the state" and establishing
                    notification requirements for future recordings — the tone was procedural, but it still
                    felt intimidating. We had never spoken before.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>That Same Day</strong>: In a follow-up call I initiated, and deliberately did not
                    record so she would feel more comfortable, I tried to explain why I had recorded the
                    meeting, hoping she would assist me. She told me to get through my time, that every park
                    is different.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>March 18</strong>: An unidentified man approached me to conduct covert assessment
                    while I worked alone, interrogating me about leadership treatment under cover of "IT
                    documentation." I immediately documented it with Kati.

                <li>
                    <strong>March 24</strong>: Immediate dismissal six days before scheduled completion, using
                    fabricated pretenses with no formal documentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>March 26</strong>: Permanent dismissal from all Oregon State Parks volunteer
                    programs, explicitly citing my public speech about the abuse as the reason.

            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE COERCIVE MEETING</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                On March 5, Ryan Warren and Kati Baker summoned me to a public picnic table for over an
                hour of psychological pressure designed to force my resignation. The entire meeting was
                recorded.
            </div>
            <div>Key moments include:</div>

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
                <li>Ryan telling me to "chew glass and swallow it" as leadership advice.</li>
                <li>Admission that I was never given the benefit of the doubt from day one.</li>
                <li>Repeated suggestions that I should "just leave" if uncomfortable.</li>
                <li>Reframing of normal communication as threatening behavior.</li>
                <li>Clear weaponization of my identity.</li>
                <li>Absolute refusal to engage in any substantive claims.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE SETUP</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                Six days before my removal, following Allison's failed attempt to eliminate recorded
                evidence through legal intimidation, an unidentified man with no uniform or identification
                approached me while I was working alone. He interrogated me with personal questions about
                leadership treatment, then disappeared. When I reported this, it was hastily explained as
                "IT photo documentation" — yet no photos were ever produced.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE DISMISSAL</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                With less than one week remaining in my assignment, Ryan Warren called requesting another
                meeting. When I asked why, he became agitated and dismissed me over the phone — using a
                homeless man's lost journal as pretext, claiming I had made inappropriate comments about
                park staff. He arrived at my RV an hour later to collect keys and site documents, admitting
                on camera that no formal documentation existed for my removal.
            </div>
            <div className="mt-4">
                Shortly after, Engagement Programs Manager Allison Watson issued a formal dismissal letter.
                In it, she explicitly stated that my public comments about my experience — not misconduct
                or behavior at the park — were the reason for my removal, citing that my statements "were
                not in line with expectations set forth in the agreement."
            </div>
            <div className="mt-4">
                This admission confirmed what the department had previously tried to obscure: that I was
                not removed for what I did, but for speaking about what was done to me. Her letter
                constitutes a written acknowledgment of retaliatory dismissal based on protected speech,
                transforming this case from a personnel dispute into institutional evidence.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                When I documented this treatment through internal channels, I was met with escalation
                rather than accountability:
            </div>

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>Regional Level</strong>: Engagement Programs Manager Allison Watson reframed
                    documented abuse as my behavioral problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>State Level</strong>: Director Lisa Sumption received detailed evidence and
                    responded with procedural language that acknowledged concerns while committing to no
                    specific accountability measures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final Result</strong>: Permanent dismissal from all Oregon State Parks volunteer
                    programs.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE EVIDENCE</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">This archive contains:</div>

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
                <li>60+ minutes of recorded meetings showing systematic psychological pressure.</li>
                <li>Video documentation of dismissal without cause or paperwork.</li>
                <li>Email correspondence revealing coordinated campaigns against me.</li>
                <li>Phone call recordings exposing institutional cover-up tactics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">WHY THIS MATTERS</h2>
            <div className="mt-4">
                This was not a misunderstanding or personality conflict. This was systematic institutional
                abuse executed against someone serving without compensation. The evidence shows a
                coordinated effort to psychologically break a volunteer who refused to fragment under
                pressure, followed by institutional protection of the abusers and punishment of the victim.
            </div>
            <div className="mt-4">
                The most direct confirmation of this came from inside the system itself. In her dismissal
                letter, Engagement Programs Manager Allison Watson explicitly stated that I was being
                removed not for misconduct, but for speaking publicly about what happened. In doing so, she
                converted what the agency might have passed off as misunderstanding into a written
                acknowledgment of retaliatory dismissal. It is rare that institutions name themselves so
                clearly. When they do, it matters.
            </div>
            <div className="mt-4">
                This case is not just about one volunteer. It is about whether Oregon State Parks tolerates
                — or encourages — the use of coercive tactics against those who speak with clarity about
                internal harm. It is about whether the system protects its image, or its people.
