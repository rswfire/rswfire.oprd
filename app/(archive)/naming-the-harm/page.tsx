            <div className="mt-4">
                After months of institutional silence, I sent two letters naming the harm directly to those
                who caused it. Not as requests for apology or repair—but as statements of record.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                These letters document what they did, how they did it, and what it cost. They ensure the
                harm cannot be minimized, reframed, or disappeared. They are permanent testimony to
                institutional abuse that leadership refused to acknowledge.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Each person had the power to choose differently. Each person chose harm. And now that
                choice is attached to their name forever.

                May 28, 2025: Holding Allison Watson Accountable

            <div className="mt-4">
                Two months and one day after my vulnerable follow-up letter was met with silence, I named
                the full scope of harm Allison Watson caused through institutional protection and
                performative empathy.

                <div className="mt-4">This letter is not a request.</div>
                <div>It is not an invitation to respond.</div>
                <div>It is a statement of record.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    I am writing to formally name the harm that occurred under your leadership — and to
                    inform you that the audio of our March 25 conversation is now public.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">That recording is not an accusation. It is a mirror.</div>
                <div>
                    And now, for the first time, others can hear what I heard — the tone, the silences, the
                    institutional language that reframed lived human experience as "concerning" and
                    "unprofessional." The video speaks for itself.

    <div className="mt-4">You asked me to speak openly. I did.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        I told you what Ryan said to me. How he told me to "eat glass." How Logan blurred
        boundaries. How I was denied the benefit of the doubt from day one. I said all of this
        calmly, clearly, without hostility, and with the hope that it might matter.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">Later that night, I sent you a follow-up letter.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        It added context, detailed evidence, and gave you another opportunity to respond with
        presence and integrity.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">You never acknowledged it.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        Instead, less than twenty-four hours later, you made my dismissal permanent — a decision
        that now lives in stark contrast to the content of our recorded call.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        So I want to name — clearly, and for the record — the full scope of harm:
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">You dismissed serious misconduct with silence.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You avoided specificity in order to maintain plausible deniability.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You framed human depth as inappropriate rather than interrogating your own discomfort.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You positioned yourself as a neutral evaluator while executing a pre-determined outcome.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You ignored a vulnerable and sincere follow-up letter, and responded instead with
        expulsion.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-8">But there is more.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You shielded misconduct by refusing to investigate or intervene — permitting coercive
        behavior and inappropriate power dynamics to persist under your leadership.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You sanctioned erasure — not only of my role, but of the narrative I offered in good
        faith.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You endorsed retaliation by validating a removal that originated not in protocol, but
        in personal offense.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You fractured systemic trust, sending a clear signal to others: that clarity is
        dangerous, and documented truth will be buried if it threatens internal comfort.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You reinforced harmful patterns by protecting those who distorted, manipulated, and
        coerced — ensuring they remain unaccountable.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You disappeared the humanity of this moment. When you had the opportunity to meet it
        with courage, you met it with closure.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">And perhaps most significantly:</div>
    <div>
        You made yourself the endpoint — not a bridge, not a voice of integrity, but a terminus.
        A silence.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">This is not about policy. It is about responsibility.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">
        You had a choice. You could have acted with presence. With reflection. With care.
    </div>
    <div>You didn't.</div>

    <div className="mt-4">I'm not asking you to undo it.</div>
    <div>
        I'm naming that it happened — and ensuring that the record will outlast the silence
        that followed.
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">The archive is now public.</div>
    <div>You are part of it.</div>
    <div>And that, too, will be permanent.</div>

        August 13, 2025: Holding Kati Baker Accountable
    </h2>

    <div className="mt-4">
        Three months later, I named the harm Kati Baker caused by weaponizing vulnerability and
        using institutional authority to punish what she refused to understand.

    <Email

    >
        <div className="mt-4">Kati,</div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            During that meeting at the day use area, you framed our early interaction as an emotional
            wound inflicted on you. You were performing, of course — and I knew this even as I
            apologized to you a second time for something that didn't warrant an apology, because I
            was trying to keep the peace.
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            But you did emotionally wound me, and now I want you to know how.
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            You took something deeply sincere and read it through the most cynical lens possible. You
            met vulnerability with suspicion, complexity with projection, and instead of asking a
            question or seeking to understand, you moved to solidify a narrative that cast me as
            dangerous. That move — conscious or not — disfigured what might have been possible
            between us.
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            I wasn't careless with you. I was just myself. And in your role, that should have mattered.
            That should have been protected. But instead, you used your authority to make me question
            whether there's any space in this institution for someone like me — someone unwilling to
            fragment, to perform, to smile past their truth just to make others feel comfortable.
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            That experience narrowed my world. It forced me to contract in places I came to serve.
            And that harm is real. And I'm still metabolizing it. It is why this letter is necessary
            - because healing requires confrontation with the truth. And now I have delivered it.
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            You didn't have to understand me. But you could have chosen not to punish what you didn't
            understand.
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
            In closing: you abused your power. Repeatedly. Covertly. You took a position that should
            require integrity, humility, and discernment — and instead, you acted to protect your own
            authority, regardless of the cost to others. That is why I built the archive. Because even
            if your institution won't hold you accountable, it will. And it is my sincere hope that it
            is enough to prevent you from ever inflicting that harm on another person again.

            Neither letter received a response. Neither needed one.

            These are not attempts at reconciliation. They are permanent documentation of harm caused

            accountability.

        <div className="mt-4">
            The archive ensures these letters outlast silence. The record is permanent. And every
