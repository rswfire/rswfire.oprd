                    After months of institutional silence, I sent letters naming the harm directly to those

                    harm cannot be minimized, reframed, or disappeared. They are permanent testimony to
                    institutional abuse that leadership refused to acknowledge.

                    You framed human depth as inappropriate rather than interrogating your own discomfort.

                    You positioned yourself as a neutral evaluator while executing a pre-determined outcome.

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You ignored a vulnerable and sincere follow-up letter, and responded instead with
                    expulsion.

                <div className="mt-8">But there is more.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You shielded misconduct by refusing to investigate or intervene &mdash; permitting coercive
                    behavior and inappropriate power dynamics to persist under your leadership.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You sanctioned erasure &mdash; not only of my role, but of the narrative I offered in good

                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You endorsed retaliation by validating a removal that originated not in protocol, but
                    in personal offense.

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You fractured systemic trust, sending a clear signal to others: that clarity is
                    dangerous, and documented truth will be buried if it threatens internal comfort.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You reinforced harmful patterns by protecting those who distorted, manipulated, and
                    coerced &mdash; ensuring they remain unaccountable.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You disappeared the humanity of this moment. When you had the opportunity to meet it

<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Kati,

During that meeting at the day use area, you framed our early interaction as an emotional wound inflicted on you. You were performing, of course — and I knew this even as I apologized to you a second time for something that didn’t warrant an apology, because I was trying to keep the peace.

But you did emotionally wound me, and now I want you to know how.

You took something deeply sincere and read it through the most cynical lens possible. You met vulnerability with suspicion, complexity with projection, and instead of asking a question or seeking to understand, you moved to solidify a narrative that cast me as dangerous. That move — conscious or not — disfigured what might have been possible between us.

I wasn't careless with you. I was just myself. And in your role, that should have mattered. That should have been protected. But instead, you used your authority to make me question whether there’s any space in this institution for someone like me — someone unwilling to fragment, to perform, to smile past their truth just to make others feel comfortable.

That experience narrowed my world. It forced me to contract in places I came to serve. And that harm is real. And I'm still metabolizing it. It is why this letter is necessary - because healing requires confrontation with the truth. And now I have delivered it.

You didn’t have to understand me. But you could have chosen not to punish what you didn’t understand.

In closing: you abused your power. Repeatedly. Covertly. You took a position that should require integrity, humility, and discernment — and instead, you acted to protect your own authority, regardless of the cost to others. That is why I built the archive. Because even if your institution won’t hold you accountable, it will. And it is my sincere hope that it is enough to prevent you from ever inflicting that harm on another person again.

            >
<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Logan,

This letter names the harm you caused through betrayal of supervisory trust and weaponization of vulnerability I shared with you in confidence.

You held authority over me as Volunteer Services Lead. That role requires integrity, discretion, and the protection of those under your supervision. You failed at every level.

THE DISCLOSURES

During our walk at Honeyman, I shared why I had moved into an RV and relocated to the coast—my analysis of systemic instability, my strategic thinking about resilience, and my concerns as a queer person about authoritarian targeting through institutional actors.

Before that conversation, I set a clear boundary: I told you explicitly this was not romantic for me.

You took what I shared in confidence and disclosed it to management. That information was then weaponized by Allison Watson to pathologize my character during dismissal proceedings—reframing reasoned analysis as "apocalyptic thinking" and using my fears about identity-based targeting as evidence of instability.

By now you have seen the videos. You know how they used what I told you. You know the harm that followed.

THE DISTORTION

Allison Watson claimed I told you "I was worried you would kill me." That is a deliberate distortion.

What I actually said was that in authoritarian contexts, people like you—institutional actors with authority—would be the mechanism through which targeting of queer people would occur.

You visibly recoiled when I said this.

At the time, I interpreted your reaction as discomfort with the subject matter. Later, I understood: you were already doing exactly what I had described—using your institutional position to target my identity.

And you did this after I explicitly told you the conversation was not romantic. You weaponized a boundary I set with you in good faith.

THE PATTERN

You elicited trust through reciprocal vulnerability. You spent 90 minutes talking about yourself—your background, your concerns, your perspectives. The following day, I reciprocated. That is how trust-building works.

But after I opened up, you distanced yourself. Then you disclosed what I shared to people who were already working to remove me.

That is not supervision. That is betrayal.

THE ENABLING

Your disclosures gave Ryan Warren, Kati Baker, and Allison Watson the ammunition they needed to justify what they had already decided to do.

Ryan used it to mock me at the day-use meeting—suggesting I "thought I had a future with you"—weaponizing my sexuality and distorting ordinary human connection into something inappropriate.

I am certain that insinuation entered the narrative with your consent.

Kati and Allison used your disclosures to construct a psychological profile justifying my permanent dismissal—reframing vulnerability as instability, analysis as extremism, and identity-based fears as concerning behavior.

You enabled that. Actively. With full knowledge of what they were doing.

WHAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND

I treated you with integrity you never had.

Despite your pattern of intimacy followed by distance, I continued to see the best in you. I made space for the tension between your depth and the institution you serve. I chose to believe you were capable of better.

I was wrong.

You had every opportunity to protect what I shared with you. Instead, you delivered it to people who used it to harm me.

That choice—to betray supervisory trust and weaponize queer vulnerability after I explicitly set a boundary with you—is now part of the permanent record.

THE RECORD

You are documented by full name in a public archive:

https://oprdvolunteerabuse.org/trust-broken

https://oprdvolunteerabuse.org/trust-broken/supplemental

This archive details:

Your disclosure of confidential personal information

Your participation in identity-based targeting

Your weaponization of a boundary I set with you

Your role in enabling institutional abuse

This is not a request for response.

This is a statement of record.

Your choices as Volunteer Services Lead are now permanently attached to your name.
