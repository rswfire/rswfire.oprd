                <div className="mt-4">This letter is not a request.</div>
                <div>It is not an invitation to respond.</div>
                <div>It is a statement of record.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    I am writing to formally name the harm that occurred under your leadership — and to
                    inform you that the audio of our March 25 conversation is now public.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">That recording is not an accusation. It is a mirror.</div>
                <div>
                    And now, for the first time, others can hear what I heard — the tone, the silences, the
                    institutional language that reframed lived human experience as "concerning" and
                    "unprofessional." The video speaks for itself.

                <div className="mt-4">You asked me to speak openly. I did.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    I told you what Ryan said to me. How he told me to "eat glass." How Logan blurred
                    boundaries. How I was denied the benefit of the doubt from day one. I said all of this
                    calmly, clearly, without hostility, and with the hope that it might matter.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">Later that night, I sent you a follow-up letter.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    It added context, detailed evidence, and gave you another opportunity to respond with
                    presence and integrity.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">You never acknowledged it.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    Instead, less than twenty-four hours later, you made my dismissal permanent — a decision
                    that now lives in stark contrast to the content of our recorded call.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">So I want to name — clearly, and for the record — the full scope of harm:</div>

                <div className="mt-4">You dismissed serious misconduct with silence.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">You avoided specificity in order to maintain plausible deniability.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You framed human depth as inappropriate rather than interrogating your own discomfort.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You positioned yourself as a neutral evaluator while executing a pre-determined outcome.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You ignored a vulnerable and sincere follow-up letter, and responded instead with
                    expulsion.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-8">But there is more.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You shielded misconduct by refusing to investigate or intervene — permitting coercive
                    behavior and inappropriate power dynamics to persist under your leadership.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You sanctioned erasure — not only of my role, but of the narrative I offered in good
                    faith.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You endorsed retaliation by validating a removal that originated not in protocol, but
                    in personal offense.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You fractured systemic trust, sending a clear signal to others: that clarity is
                    dangerous, and documented truth will be buried if it threatens internal comfort.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You reinforced harmful patterns by protecting those who distorted, manipulated, and
                    coerced — ensuring they remain unaccountable.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You disappeared the humanity of this moment. When you had the opportunity to meet it
                    with courage, you met it with closure.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">And perhaps most significantly:</div>
                <div>
                    You made yourself the endpoint — not a bridge, not a voice of integrity, but a terminus.
                    A silence.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">This is not about policy. It is about responsibility.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">
                    You had a choice. You could have acted with presence. With reflection. With care.
                </div>
                <div>You didn't.</div>

                <div className="mt-4">I'm not asking you to undo it.</div>
                <div>
                    I'm naming that it happened — and ensuring that the record will outlast the silence
                    that followed.
                </div>

                <div className="mt-4">The archive is now public.</div>
                <div>You are part of it.</div>
