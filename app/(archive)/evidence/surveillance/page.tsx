                While cleaning the yurts in A Loop, an unidentified man approached me. He was not in uniform. He carried no identification. He offered no name.

            <div className="mt-4">
                He said he was "with the park service" and was taking photos of the yurts — while they were still dirty, mid-clean, with doors propped open, sanitizer running, trash cans holding doors ajar.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Then, without transition, he pressed me with direct personal questions:

            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>"How do you like the park?"</li>

            </ul>

            <div className="mt-4">
                When I didn't engage, he asked again — reframed the questions, stepped closer. It was intimate. It was forced.

                This occurred during a regional event when all rangers were away.

<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Hi Kati,

I wanted to check in about something from today.

While I was working, a man showed up, said he was with the park service, and started taking photos of the yurts while they were still dirty, since I was in the process of cleaning them. I engaged him briefly—asked if he had any questions—but the interaction felt a little off.

He didn't introduce himself by name, wasn't in uniform, and had no visible identification. He only said he was with the park service and that they "needed photos of some of them still." Then he started asking me questions—how I like the park, how I'm being treated here. It stood out, especially with the timing, since all the rangers were away for meetings.

Was this an official visit that you're aware of? If so, no problem—just seemed a bit odd, and I wasn't sure if I should have handled it differently. If not, I wanted to flag it in case it's something to be aware of. Let me know if you have any insight.

Thanks,
Sam

<pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{`Hi Sam,

We have had some staff from I.T. working on getting updated photos of sites all over the state. I think you handled it wonderfully asking if they had any other questions. It's not unusual for folks to want to take a look inside especially if they haven't seen a yurt before. I can follow up with folks in I.T. to see if anyone was out today :)

Just wanted to let you know I did reach out to the I.T. employee who is spearheading the site photo updates and it was indeed them who was out getting photos of yurts in A loop 😊

Have a great afternoon!

                I thought he was interested in me. I thought he struck out because he played power games instead of being authentic.
