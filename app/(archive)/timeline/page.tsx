                I was scheduled to leave Honeyman on March 30 and begin my next assignment at Tugman
                State Park — somewhere I had already volunteered, somewhere I was welcomed.

            <div className="mt-4">I was calm. I was complete. I was prepared to go clean.</div>
            <div>But Ryan Warren and Kati Baker couldn't let me leave intact.</div>
            <div>
                And what followed was a chain reaction that exposed how fragile the system really is —
                and how catastrophically they misread the field.

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">🎯 WHAT THIS SEQUENCE REVEALS</h2>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>This was never about performance.</strong></div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                Every evaluation praised my work quality. A ranger documented my competence with his
                supervisors. I was dismissed for holding my shape, not for failing standards.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>This was never about policy violations.</strong></div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                No paperwork existed. No formal process was followed. No documented infractions were
                cited. They created procedure on the spot to justify predetermined outcomes.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>This was about institutional panic over documented evidence.</strong>
            </div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                The recorded meeting created permanent evidence of systematic abuse they couldn't control.
                Each escalation — legal intimidation, covert assessment, accelerated removal — represented
                institutional desperation to eliminate accountability documentation.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>This was about misrecognition.</strong></div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                They thought they were managing a disposable volunteer. They were actually performing for
                a strategic observer with documentation skills, platform access, and uncompromising ethical
                boundaries.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>This was about institutional coordination above park level.</strong>
            </div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                Covert operative deployment likely required administrative authorization beyond what local
                managers could implement independently. State-level resources were allocated to eliminate
                a volunteer who maintained comprehensive documentation capability.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>This was about power miscalculation.</strong></div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                They wielded institutional authority expecting submission. Instead, they created
                documentation of systematic abuse that would outlast their ability to contain it.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">🔄 THE REVERSAL</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">They wanted to mark me with institutional failure.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">Instead, they marked themselves with documented abuse.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">They wanted to control the narrative.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">Instead, they lost control of their own story.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">They wanted to erase me quietly.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">Instead, they made themselves permanently visible.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">The system didn't collapse because it was weak.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                It collapsed because it was <strong>wrong</strong> — and someone was watching who couldn't
                be managed, broken, or disappeared.

            <div className="mt-8 italic text-gray-600 text-center">
                Every action after the recorded meeting was institutional panic masquerading as procedure.
