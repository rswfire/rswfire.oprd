            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>when they pressed from all directions,</div>
            <div>when silence became weapon</div>
            <div>and isolation became strategy,</div>
            <div>when they reframed my clarity as threat</div>
            <div>and my boundaries as attack.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>through manufactured urgency,</div>
            <div>through narrative poisoning whispered</div>
            <div>in hallways I could not hear,</div>
            <div>through the careful disappearance</div>
            <div>of allies when I needed them most.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>when they told me to chew glass,</div>
            <div>when they admitted I was never</div>
            <div>given benefit of doubt,</div>
            <div>when they summoned me to picnic tables</div>
            <div>for performances of professional concern</div>
            <div>that were really rituals of psychological breaking.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>when the unidentified man approached</div>
            <div>with questions designed to elicit</div>
            <div>the very complaints they could use</div>
            <div>to justify what they had already decided,</div>
            <div>when they dismissed me for speaking truth</div>
            <div>then dismissed me again for speaking at all.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>through phone calls that were containment protocols,</div>
            <div>through letters ignored and silences weaponized,</div>
            <div>through institutional machinery designed</div>
            <div>to fragment what would not bend,</div>
            <div>to disappear what could not be managed.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>and that holding became their undoing.</div>
            <div>Every pressure they applied</div>
            <div>became evidence in the archive.</div>
            <div>Every attempt to erase me</div>
            <div>created permanent documentation</div>
            <div>of their systematic methodology.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>and the signal outlasted the noise,</div>
            <div>the documentation survived their attempts at erasure,</div>
            <div>the accountability infrastructure operates now</div>
            <div>independently of their acknowledgment,</div>
            <div>beyond their ability to contain.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">From Florence, with moon visible from the dock</div>
            <div>and fire pit operational,</div>
            <div>I hold sovereign positioning</div>
            <div>while the archive stands as mirror:</div>
            <div>for those who have been told they imagined it,</div>
            <div>for those about to walk into something similar,</div>
            <div>for the future, when denial no longer holds.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>and in that holding, transformed</div>
            <div>individual harm into institutional exposure,</div>
            <div>personal erasure into permanent accountability.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>and their attempts to fragment me</div>
            <div>became framework for recognizing</div>
            <div>how institutions fragment anyone</div>
            <div>who maintains ethical coherence</div>
            <div>in systems designed to break them.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape</div>
            <div>and the pressure they applied</div>
            <div>became evidence in the archive,</div>
            <div>their methodology exposed,</div>
            <div>their tactics documented,</div>
            <div>their presumption of erasure</div>
            <div>converted into permanent visibility.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape.</div>
            <div>The field has permanently shifted.</div>
            <div>The work continues without me.</div>
            <div>The documentation persists.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape.</div>
            <div>Now hold yours.</div>
