            <div className="mt-4">
                I arrived at Honeyman State Park not to fill a shift, but to hold a field —
            </div>
            <div>a sovereign man in alignment, in service, not to authority, but to coherence.</div>
            <div>I came prepared. I came committed. I came clean.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                And from the moment I showed up fully — visibly queer, pierced, calm, integrated —
            </div>
            <div>they didn't know what to do with me.</div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE FIRST FRACTURE</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">It began with a power outage.</div>
            <div>I texted Kati, the park supervisor, early in the morning —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">clear, respectful, naming the perception issue with guests.</div>
            <div>She responded dismissively.</div>
            <div>I followed up, naming how her tone made me feel.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">Not as a complaint — as a human reflection.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">That should have been a moment of connection.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">Instead, it marked me.</div>
            <div>From that day forward, the tone of the park shifted.</div>
            <div>Ryan, the park manager, came into the Welcome Center —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">not with curiosity, but with rehearsed authority.</div>
            <div>He unearthed first-week errors, presented them like a case file.</div>
            <div>It wasn't feedback.</div>
            <div>It was pretext.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">My supervisor, Logan, vanished — conveniently unavailable.</div>
            <div>Leaving me to navigate power dynamics as a brand new volunteer.</div>
            <div>Then reappeared only once I had navigated the situation on my own —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">this would become a pattern.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I stayed calm. I stayed kind.</div>
            <div>I asked for a reset.</div>
            <div>They said yes —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">but the narrative was already seeded.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">And they would return to it again and again,</div>
            <div className="ml-8">Over the next two months.</div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">DISTORTION AS POLICY</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">I applied for a job at Honeyman —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">
                not out of desperation, but because I liked the park, the rhythm, the work.
            </div>
            <div>That application was never acknowledged.</div>
            <div>Instead, I was met with awkward silence, thin smiles, retreating contact.</div>
            <div>So I withdrew the application, but even this got met with suspicion.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">So when I shared my truth —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">my background, my journey, my sacrifices —</div>
            <div className="ml-8">Logan didn't receive it.</div>
            <div>Instead, he tried to manage my perception.</div>
            <div>And would later weaponize it.</div>
            <div>And then disappear again.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">And then they manufactured a situation —</div>
            <div>When I asked to be trained by a certain park ranger, to prevent distortion,</div>
            <div className="ml-4">Logan said yes, but then didn't follow through.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They wanted to see me fail.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They wanted me to feel uncomfortable.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They wanted me to leave.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I wrote him the trust email —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">clear, principled, accountable.</div>
            <div>Instead of responding directly,</div>
            <div>they convened a meeting.</div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE ORCHESTRATED CONFRONTATION</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">Ryan and Kati summoned me to the day-use area.</div>
            <div>A picnic table, a public setting, the illusion of calm.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">What followed was a scripted performance of coercion.</div>
            <div>For over an hour...</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They framed my emails as threats.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They pathologized my clarity as "unprofessional."</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They refused to offer specifics, yet insisted I was a problem.</div>
            <div className="ml-4">They demanded I extend positive intent —</div>
            <div className="ml-8">even as they openly admitted —</div>
            <div className="ml-12">they'd never once offered me the benefit of the doubt.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">Ryan told me I'd need to "chew glass" —</div>
            <div>and framed it as leadership wisdom.</div>
            <div>But what he meant was submit.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I recorded the meeting —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">because I already knew what was coming.</div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE FINAL MOVE</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">Weeks passed. I kept working. Professionally. Precisely.</div>
            <div>No infractions. No escalation.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">But they couldn't leave me intact.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">Ryan called, days before I was scheduled to leave.</div>
            <div>He wanted another meeting.</div>
            <div>When I asked why, he said I was "still" being a problem.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">Still.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">Not because of my actions — but because of my presence.</div>
            <div>Because I had not fractured.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I named it for what it was —</div>
            <div>I told him he was a bully.</div>
            <div>and in that moment, the performance unraveled.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">He came to my RV.</div>
            <div>Dismissed me without paperwork.</div>
            <div>Accepted my keys with a reasonable tone,</div>
            <div>masking deliberate erasure as protocol.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">That was their final maneuver:</div>
            <div>Ensure I did not leave on my own terms.</div>
            <div>Ensure I carried a mark.</div>
            <div>Ensure the narrative stayed theirs.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">But I had already built the archive.</div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">WHAT THEY DID</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">They misread my coherence as confrontation.</div>
            <div>They punished integrity because it disrupted their comfort.</div>
            <div>They used silence as strategy.</div>
            <div>Tone as weapon.</div>
            <div>Policy as shield.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">They created an environment where depth was reframed as danger.</div>
            <div>Where presence was unwelcome unless it could be controlled.</div>
            <div>Where authenticity was pathologized — and then expelled.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">This was not incompetence.</div>
            <div>This was not miscommunication.</div>
            <div>This was institutional harm, deliberately executed by people who chose</div>
            <div className="ml-4">performance over presence,</div>
            <div className="ml-4">control over contact,</div>
            <div className="ml-4">narrative over truth.</div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">WHAT I DID</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">I held my shape.</div>
            <div>I named the distortions.</div>
            <div>I documented everything.</div>
            <div>I built this record.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">And now, it stands —</div>
            <div className="ml-4">not as retribution,</div>
            <div className="ml-8">but as mirror.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">To anyone reading this — inside or outside the institution:</div>

            <div className="mt-4">This is what it looks like when coherence survives collapse.</div>
            <div>This is what it sounds like when the signal outlasts the noise.</div>

            <div className="mt-4">I am still here.</div>
            <div>And the archive speaks.</div>
