What began as a routine volunteer assignment became two months of systematic psychological pressure, coercive tactics, and institutional retaliation, followed by dismissal and expulsion from all <Link href="https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/AO/Pages/AU-about.aspx" target="_blank" className="underline text-emerald-800 hover:text-emerald-600">Oregon State Parks</Link> &mdash; all documented with audio and video evidence.
