            <div className="mt-4">
                The central insight from my experience at Honeyman State Park isn't about bad supervisors
                or dysfunctional policies. It's about fragmentation.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Institutions survive by fragmenting people — splitting you into parts they can manage,
                control, and ultimately discard. They separate your "professional self" from your human
                needs, your compliance from your integrity, your survival from your values. Once you're
                fragmented, you become predictable. Manageable. Disposable.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                The people who harmed me at Honeyman weren't uniquely evil. They were executing a playbook
                that exists in every workplace, every volunteer program, every hierarchical system. They
                were trying to fragment me the same way they had been fragmented.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                Here's what I learned about staying whole in systems designed to break you apart.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">THE FRAGMENTATION PLAYBOOK</h2>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>How institutions fragment people:</strong></div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Isolation</strong> — They separate you from allies, information, and support
                systems. Logan disappearing when I needed backup. Rangers being conveniently away during
                critical moments.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Reframing</strong> — They take your reasonable responses and pathologize them. My
                clear communication became "aggressive." My boundary-setting became "problematic."
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Gaslighting</strong> — They make you doubt your own perception. Was Ryan really
                that hostile? Was that meeting actually coercive? The recordings proved my sanity.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Manufactured Scarcity</strong> — They create artificial urgency and pressure. "You
                could just leave if you're uncomfortable." Making my continued presence feel like a burden.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Identity Splitting</strong> — They force you to choose between authentic
                self-expression and institutional acceptance. My queerness, my depth, my integrity — all
                became "unprofessional."
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Narrative Poisoning</strong> — They tell stories about you to others that create
                distance and doubt. Colleagues start treating you differently. Your reputation gets quietly
                damaged. People avoid you without knowing why. Ryan's insinuation that I had "inappropriate
                feelings" for Logan, spread to others, weaponizing both my sexuality and normal human
                connection.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Historical Erasure</strong> — They deny patterns, refuse documentation, disappear
                evidence. "No paperwork exists" for my dismissal. My follow-up letter was never
                acknowledged.
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4">
                The goal isn't to destroy you outright. It's to make you fragment yourself — to teach you
                to self-police, self-silence, self-manage until you become complicit in your own
                diminishment.
            </div>

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">STAYING WHOLE: PRACTICAL RESISTANCE</h2>

            <div className="mt-4">
                <strong>Most people don't have my advantages</strong>. I had decades of independence as a
                freelancer, technical skills, platform access, and years of practice holding boundaries
                under pressure. But everyone can develop some version of these practices:
            </div>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>Document Everything</strong></div>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>Save all communications</strong>. Screenshots, emails, text threads. Even casual
                    conversations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Note dates, times, witnesses</strong>. You don't need recordings — just
                    consistent record-keeping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Write summary emails</strong>. "Thanks for our conversation today about X. Just
                    to confirm, you said Y and we agreed on Z."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep personal copies</strong>. Don't rely on company systems. Use personal email,
                    personal cloud storage.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>Recognize the Patterns Early</strong></div>
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>Trust your body</strong>. If interactions leave you feeling destabilized,
                    confused, or questioning yourself — that's data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Watch for isolation tactics</strong>. Are your normal support people suddenly
                    unavailable? Are you being excluded from routine communications?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Notice reframing</strong>. When your reasonable concerns get pathologized as
                    "attitude problems" or "communication issues."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Track escalation</strong>. Small conflicts that become big issues overnight
                    usually indicate orchestrated pressure.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div className="mt-4"><strong>Maintain Your Integrity Architecture</strong></div>

                <li>
                    <strong>Know your non-negotiables</strong>. What values won't you compromise? What
                    treatment won't you accept?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communicate clearly, without emotion</strong>. State facts. Ask direct questions.
                    Don't justify your humanity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don't absorb their narrative</strong>. When they tell you you're the problem,
                    check with people outside the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep perspective</strong>. Their institutional chaos is not your personal failure.

                    <strong>Find witnesses outside the institution</strong>. Friends, family, other
                    volunteers who can reality-check your experience.

                <li>
                    <strong>Document to people who care about you</strong>. Regular check-ins where you share

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Know your resources</strong>. Labor boards, ombudsman offices, professional
                    organizations, legal aid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Have an exit strategy</strong>. Financial cushion, alternative opportunities,
                    places to land if they push you out.

                <li>
                    <strong>Don't apologize for existing</strong>. Your depth, your questions, your humanity

                <li>

                The antidote isn't individual resilience — though that matters. The antidote is collective
                refusal to fragment. When we document, witness, and support each other, we make their
                strategies visible and therefore less effective.

                Most people can't build something this comprehensive. But everyone can practice the
                principles: stay whole, document patterns, seek external perspective, and refuse to absorb
                institutional narratives that diminish your humanity.
